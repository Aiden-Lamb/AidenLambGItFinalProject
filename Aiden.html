      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p id="Information">
        My name is Aiden Lamb, I'm 18 years old and I was born in Saint John,
        but I've lived in Hampton my whole life. I graduated from Hampton High
        School in 2023 and am currently attending NBCC Saint John taking the
        Information Technology: Programmer Analyst course. I started to get
        really into coding when I was in grade 12 and I took a Computer Science
        class. The teacher who taught the class was very knowledgable and
        although I had no prior knowledge of coding, I caught on really quick
        and was instantly hooked. I ended up making a working weather station
        with my teacher as my final project and it's still hooked up on the roof
        of Hampton High School collecting weather data to this day. Before this
        class, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and wasn't sure of
        anything post secondary wise, but my parents asked me if I wanted to
        look into courses at NBCC involving computer science as they could tell
        I was loving it. The second semester of Grade 12, I took a Cybersecurity
        course with that same teacher and loved that as well. That's when my
        parents and I came across the ITPA course. It seemed to align with
        everything I loved doing already, and the course is a prerequisite for
        the Cybersecurity course, so it worked out perfectly.
